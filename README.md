# interface-model

This branch is designed to contrast the differences between the existing, abstract
class model and a newer, interface-based model. I am sure this model will be **safer**,
and potentially more user-friendly, but I do not know for sure how the performance
will compare. I'll be examining this problem and deciding on a final model in the
coming weeks.

**Work in progress**
